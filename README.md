# Aether Design System

This design system is built using [ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter) with the [expansion pack](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/expansion-pack), then adjusted based on the needs of the project.

Aether serves as the building block for our projects. Feel free to use this design system for your projects.

Expansions used:

- [React Hook Form](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/expansion-pack#react-hook-form)
- [Toast with React Query](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/expansion-pack#react-query)
- [Dialog Manager with Zustand](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/expansion-pack#react-query)
- [NProgress](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/expansion-pack#nprogress)

## Motive

We usually build a design system before the start of a project. Aether is an actual design system we use for our private projects, and we decided to open-source it.
